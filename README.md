# Hey there, I'm Job 👋

### 🚀 Building cool stuff from Lagos to the world

I'm a **chill, creative software engineer** who codes with lo-fi beats and dreams in APIs. Currently vibing as **Fullstack Software Engineer** at Toplorgical LTD by day, and **CTO & Co-founder** of Flippinkool (comic reading platform) and Cv2Essence (career app/jobboard) by night. Self-taught, slightly introverted, but always down to build something awesome - especially my own ventures.
